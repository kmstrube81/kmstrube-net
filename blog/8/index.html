Follow this guide and you’ll learn the steps needed to be able to import your game saves into Afterplay and pick up right where you left off!\nFollow these quick instructions for simple advice on importing your save\nOpen the game after importing it into Afterplay and open the “Saves and Settings” menu. Go to the “Game” tab under the settings and scroll down to “Auto-load state” and disable that setting. Go to Saves -\u003e SRAM -\u003e “Add SRAM” Browse to your save in your phone/PC directory and select your save. Close the game, Reopen it. Video Guide: Step by Step Step 1 Open the Afterplay app (pinned to homescreen) or go to afterplay.io and launch the game whose save you want to import. If not yet uploaded go ahead and upload the game. Notice in the example game, Super Mario Kart, that only the 50cc and 100cc modes have been unlocked. Once the game has loaded, press the menu button at the bottom-right of your screen and choose “Saves and Settings”\nStep 2 Scroll the menu headers to the right to the “Game” tab. Under “Game”, scroll down until you find the “Auto-load state” button. Toggle this setting off. Scroll back up to the menu headers and scroll back left to the “Saves” tab. The default page is “Autosaves”, choose “SRAM”, and then choose the “Add SRAM” button. Browse to your save on your device and select it. Afterplay saves use the .srm file extension. Some emulators use .sav instead. In most cases the file extension can just be changed to .srm and the save file will be compatible with Afterplay\nStep 3 Your save file has been imported but hasn’t been loaded into the emulator yet. You must close the game and reopen it first. When the example, Super Mario Kart, is reloaded, we can see that now 150cc is listed with the othe two modes and that all trophies are unlocked when checking the cups. It is reccomended to create a manual save state and then turn “Auto-load state” back on if you wish to use save states going forward. These steps must be followed in this order or the save won’t be loaded by afterplay.
